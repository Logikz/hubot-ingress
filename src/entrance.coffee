Welcome to Slack! :allthethings:  
Please enjoy the use of our ingress bot - Jarvis.  You can type ```jarvis help``` for command usage.  
Please only use jarvis in general or in private message directly to Jarvis.  He can be quite the talker :). 
Feel free to make public and private chat rooms to discuss various topics.  If you want help inserting your badges please see: http://enlightened.la/badges/

If you need any help, feel free to message Logikz.
